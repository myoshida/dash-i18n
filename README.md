# dash-i18n

Dash-i18n is a concise internationalization (i18n) library for
JavaScript.  But it is good enough for almost everything.

If you have a large project and you are a perfectionist, you may be
happy with a full-fledged i18n framework.  Otherwise we believe
dash-i18n is good for most use cases.
