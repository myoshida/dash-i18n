Introduction
------------

Dash-i18n is a tiny library for internationalization for JavaScript.
But it is good enough for almost everything.

If you have a large project and a perfectionist, you may be happy with
a full-fledged i18n framework.
Otherwise we believe dash-i18n is good for most use cases.
